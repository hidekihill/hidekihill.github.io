## About
MEng student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. One of 40 students across six U of T Engineering departments participating in the Faculty's inaugural MEng co-op class; read more about the MEng co-op stream on the [U of T Engineering website](https://gradstudies.engineering.utoronto.ca/master-of-engineering-meng/meng-co-op-program/?utm_source=FASE_ECE&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=meng_coop).

I was a Teaching Assistant for the Fall 2025 delivery of MAT290H1F: Advanced Engineering Mathematics and currently work as a Facilities Assistant within the VP Operations and Real Estate Partnerships division at U of T.

In June 2025, I graduated from McMaster University's Honours Mathematics and Statistics program with a minor in business. See the projects page to view my undergraduate thesis.
