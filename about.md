Welcome! I am an MEng student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. I am one of 40 students across six Engineering departments at U of T to participate in the inaugural MEng co-op class. Read more about the MEng co-op stream on the [U of T Engineering website](https://gradstudies.engineering.utoronto.ca/master-of-engineering-meng/meng-co-op-program/?utm_source=FASE_ECE&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=meng_coop).

I am focusing my coursework and projects in data analytics, machine learning, and communication theory. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning to autonomous driving and traffic control.

I am currently appointed by ECE as a Teaching Assistant for MAT290: Advanced Engineering Mathematics, and work as a student residence Facilities Assistant within the Operations and Real Estate partnerships division at U of T.

In June 2025, I graduated from McMaster University's Honours Mathematics and Statistics program. View the projects page on the sidebar to read about my undergraduate thesis.
