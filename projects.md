## Computations with a Family of Kloosterman Sums
H. Hill, sup. C. Franc. Undergraduate thesis formulating a series of computations of Kloosterman sums resulting from a particular family of three-dimensional representations
of the modular group PSL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**) (the projective special linear group of 2 by 2 matrices with integer entries).

## Information theoretic coding schemes
In python, writing a script to implement and visualize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> algorithm given a list of probabilities of the form {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub> s.t. &Sigma p<sub>i</sub>=1}; writing a script to implement the Lempel-Ziv <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">coding algorithm</a> given a binary string of the form (10010100101011010...).
