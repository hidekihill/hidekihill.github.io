## AffectFusion 
S. Ajadalu, Y. Attafuah, H. Hill. AffectFusion: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Affective State Recognition with Applications to Online Education Systems.

## Computations with a Family of Three-Dimensional Kloosterman Sums
H. Hill, sup. C. Franc. Undergraduate thesis formulating a series of computations of Kloosterman sums resulting from a particular family of three-dimensional representations
of the modular group PSL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**).

* View my <a href="https://hidekihill.github.io/HidekiHill_ThesisTalk_slides.pdf">slides</a> from my talk at McMaster's Department of Mathematics and Statistics 2025 undergraduate thesis presentations.
* View my thesis on McMaster's Mathematics and Statistics <a href="https://math.mcmaster.ca/undergraduate/useful-links/undergraduate-research-projects/">departmental website</a>. Also available as a

TBC: python script for graphing complex-valued exponential Kloosterman sums. Inspired by <a href="https://blogs.ethz.ch/kowalski/the-kloostermania-page/">E. Kowalski</a>'s Kloostermania. 

## Notes from the Margin (Canadian Mathematical Society)
I have written two mathematical expository research articles for the CMS student journal <em>Notes from the Margin</em>.
* Vol. 19, December 2025. Containing the infinite with the Kronecker-Weber theorem. View the <a href="https://studc.math.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NftM-W2025.pdf">Winter 2025 issue</a>.
* Vol. 18, June 2025. Exploring the transcendence of pi. View the <a href="https://studc.math.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NftM-S2025.pdf">Summer 2025 issue</a>.

## Information theortic coding schemes: Huffman and LZ implementation in Python with visualization
A tool to implement and visualize/trace the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman algorithm</a> given the probabilities associated with the probabiltiy density function of a discrete random variable. This constraint can be written as {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub> s.t. &Sigma; p<sub>i</sub>=1}

View the <a href="https://github.com/hidekihill/huffman-coding/tree/main">GitHub repository</a>.

Examples of the current functionality of the Huffman script include:

An elementary "toy" example:

An example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution">uniform distribution</a> on a discrete alphabet of size 10, characterized by its identical probabilities across each event:

An example of a probability measure on 7 events generated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a>:

TBC: implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">Lempel-Ziv algorithm</a> given a binary string of the form (10010100101011010...).
