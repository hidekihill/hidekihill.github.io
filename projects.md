## Information theortic coding schemes: Huffman and LZ implementation in Python with visualization
In python, writing a script to implement and visualize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman algorithm</a> given the probabilities associated with the probabiltiy density function of a discrete random variable. This constraint can be written as {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub> s.t. &Sigma; p<sub>i</sub>=1}

Examples of the current functionality of the Huffman script include:

An elementary "toy" example.

An example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution">uniform distribution</a> on a discrete alphabet of size 10, characterized by its identical probabilities across all events.

An example of a randomly generated probability event set using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a>, characterized by its summation constraints identical to the ones imposed by Huffman.

TBC: implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">Lempel-Ziv algorithm</a> given a binary string of the form (10010100101011010...).
