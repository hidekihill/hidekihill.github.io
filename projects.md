## AffectFusion
S. Ajadalu, Y. Attafuah, H. Hill. A multimodal deep learning framework for affective state recognition.

## Computations with a Family of Kloosterman Sums
H. Hill, sup. C. Franc. Undergraduate thesis formulating a series of computations of Kloosterman sums resulting from a particular family of three-dimensional representations
of the modular group PSL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**) (the projective special linear group of 2 by 2 matrices with integer entries).

TBC: python script for graphing complex-valued exponential Kloosterman sums. Inspired by <a href="https://blogs.ethz.ch/kowalski/the-kloostermania-page/">E. Kowalski</a>'s Kloostermania.
